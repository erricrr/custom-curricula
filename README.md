# Custom Curricula
The "Custom Curricula" tool empowers teachers to craft personalized math word problems that connect with each student's interests and address their learning gaps. By inputting student hobbies and areas of difficulty, teachers can generate engaging problems that resonate with students, making math relevant and exciting. This approach not only boosts student motivation but also fosters deeper understanding and skill development tailored to individual needs.

The data in `student_data.csv` uses fictitious LLM-generated student data.

Currently, it runs Gemini-pro locally. This project is not for production. It runs in a Jupyter Notebook and does not have a user interface.
