# Custom Curricula
The "Custom Curricula" tool empowers teachers to create personalized math word problems that connect with students' interests and address their learning gaps. By inputting students' hobbies and weaknesses, teachers can generate engaging problems that resonate with learners, potentially making math more relevant and exciting. This approach may boost student motivation and encourage a deeper understanding and skill development tailored to individual needs.

The data in `student_data.csv` uses fictitious LLM-generated student data.

Currently, it runs **Gemini-pro** locally in a Jupyter Notebook (`gemini-pro-for-teachers.ipynb`). This tool is not for production. There's no user interface at the moment. Also, the output has not been evaluated for accuracy.
