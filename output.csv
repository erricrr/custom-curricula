Aisha,Drawing,Soccer,Fractions,5th,10,"Aisha is drawing a picture of her soccer team. She wants to divide the paper into 4 equal sections to draw each player. If the paper is 12 inches wide, what fraction of the paper will each player occupy?","1. Divide the paper into 4 equal sections: Each section will be 12 ÷ 4 = 3 inches.
2. Convert the width of each section to a fraction of the total paper width: 3 inches / 12 inches = 1/4
3. Therefore, each player will occupy 1/4 of the paper."

Mei,Baking,Ballet,Geometry,6th,11,"Mei loves ballet, and she wants to design a rectangular stage for her next performance. The stage will be 12 feet long and 8 feet wide. Mei wants to add a border around the stage that is 1 foot wide on all sides.

How much border material will Mei need to purchase?","Step 1: Calculate the perimeter of the original stage.
Perimeter = 2(Length + Width) = 2(12 ft + 8 ft) = 40 ft

Step 2: Calculate the perimeter of the new stage (including the border).
New Perimeter = 2(New Length + New Width)

Step 3: Determine the width of the border.
Border Width = New Width - Original Width = 8 ft + 2 ft - 8 ft = 2 ft

Step 4: Calculate the length of the border material needed.
Border Length = New Perimeter - Original Perimeter = 40 ft + 4 ft - 40 ft = 4 ft

Step 5: Calculate the amount of border material needed.
Border Material = Border Length  Border Width = 4 ft  2 ft = 8 sq ft"
Kai,Basketball,Reading,Word Problems,6th,11,"Kai loves playing basketball. During his practice, he made 12 out of 18 free throw shots. If Kai continued practicing and made 4 more shots, what percentage of his total shots did he make?","Step 1: Find the total number of shots Kai made.
12 shots (initial) + 4 shots (additional) = 16 shots

Step 2: Find the total number of shots Kai attempted.
18 shots (initial) + 4 shots (additional) = 22 shots

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of shots made.
(16 shots made / 22 shots attempted) x 100% = 72.73% (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, Kai made 72.73% of his total shots."
Lila,Wrestling,Roller skating,Division,5th,10,Lila loves wrestling. She has 24 wrestling toys. She wants to divide them equally among her 6 friends. How many toys will each friend get?,"1. Understand the problem: Lila has 24 toys and wants to divide them equally among 6 friends.

3. Solve the problem:

```
24 ÷ 6 = 4
```

4. Check the answer: We can check our answer by multiplying the number of toys each friend gets by the number of friends:

```
4 × 6 = 24
```

This equals the total number of toys, so our answer is correct.

Answer: Each friend will get 4 wrestling toys."

Sofia,Writing poems,Gymnastics,Ratios,6th,11,"Sofia is a talented gymnast who loves to write poems. She practices gymnastics for 2 hours every day and writes poems for 1 hour every day. If Sofia spends a total of 21 hours on these hobbies in a week, what is the ratio of the time she spends on gymnastics to the time she spends on writing poems?","Step 1: Find the total number of hours Sofia spends on her hobbies in a week.
2 hours/day × 7 days/week = 14 hours on gymnastics
1 hour/day × 7 days/week = 7 hours on writing poems
14 hours + 7 hours = 21 hours total

Step 2: Write the ratio of gymnastics time to writing time.
Ratio = Gymnastics time : Writing time
Ratio = 14 hours : 7 hours

Step 3: Simplify the ratio.
Divide both sides by 7 to get:
Ratio = 2 : 1

Therefore, the ratio of the time Sofia spends on gymnastics to the time she spends on writing poems is 2 : 1."
Leo,Soccer,Collecting rocks,Patterns,6th,11,"Leo loves collecting rocks. He has arranged his rocks in a pattern. The first row has 3 rocks, the second row has 5 rocks, the third row has 7 rocks, and so on. If Leo continues this pattern, how many rocks will he have in the 10th row?","Step 1: Identify the pattern. The pattern is that each row has 2 more rocks than the previous row.

Step 2: Find the rule for the pattern. To find the number of rocks in a row, we can use the rule: number of rocks = 2  row number + 1.

Step 3: Substitute the given row number into the rule. For the 10th row, we have:

```
number of rocks = 2  10 + 1
number of rocks = 20 + 1
number of rocks = 21
```

Therefore, Leo will have 21 rocks in the 10th row."
