    "\n",
    "**Introducing \"Custom Curricula,\" the revolutionary tool that empowers teachers to craft personalized math word problems tailored to each student's unique interests, hobbies, and learning gaps.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**No more dry, textbook problems!** With Custom Curricula, teachers can create problems that resonate with students, whether they're passionate about sports, music, video games, or anything in between, all while addressing specific areas where they need extra support. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's how it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Teachers input student interests, hobbies, and areas of difficulty.\n",
    "2. Custom Curricula generates engaging word problems based on those inputs.\n",
    "3. Students tackle problems that feel relevant, exciting, and address their individual needs.**\n",
    "4. Learning becomes a personalized journey, fostering deeper understanding, motivation, and targeted skill development.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom Curricula isn't just for in-class assignments.** It's also a powerful tool for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creating customized exams that reflect student interests and address learning gaps.\n",
    "* Providing engaging extra credit opportunities that reinforce specific skills.\n",
    "* Offering personalized practice problems to target individual weaknesses and promote mastery.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With Custom Curricula, teachers can:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Boost student engagement and motivation.\n",
    "* Make math relevant and relatable to students' lives.\n",
    "* Promote deeper understanding and critical thinking.\n",
    "* Personalize learning for every student, addressing individual strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom Curricula is more than just a tool; it's a revolution in math education.** \n",
